Initial About

This is a project that will be used to practice and hone the basic HTML 
skills that I have been learning through the Odin Project.

By the time that I am done with the project, I should be able to do all
of the basic HTML skills like creating boilerplate code, creating
paragraphs, creating links and displaying images, and pushing
the project to github.  

P.S.  I am wrapping all the text at around 72 characters to practicing
wrapping text for git commit bodies.  I am using the column number in
the bottom right to confirm the amount of characters I am putting in 
a line.

Remember.  All git commands need to be run from my projects folder.  
My project's folder is the repository that I created through github.
If you create an initial project folder through your local computer
then it may be more worthwhile to initialize the repository through
your local project folder.
