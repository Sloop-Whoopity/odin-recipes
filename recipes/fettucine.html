        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The following recipe prepares one of the best Fettucine Alfredo dishes I've ever had after<strong> Del Taco's Taco flavored Fettucine Alfredo</strong>.</p>

             <p>This recipe uses very simple ingredients to create an effective blend of herbs, spices, and cheese.  The quick turnaround time to prepare 
            the dish ensures that you won't regret the time, <em>just the calories</em>!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>heavy cream</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot.</strong> Add salt to the water to season the pasta. 
                Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Saute the garlic and butter together</strong> until softened â€” about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add <em>heavy</em> cream</strong> and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
                Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Save some pasta water.</strong> The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta</strong> and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. 
                Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish with Italian parsley,</strong> if so desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Source</h3>
        <p>While this isn't required in the project, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the source for the recipe as it isn't my recipe.  Even in practice, its 
            important to give credit where its due.</p>
